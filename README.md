# Stellar
Startup website

*NOTE: The site is under development*

We will create a website that will give the creators the option to choose from a bunch of
services including but not limited to, digitizing, marketing, and selling their creations.
When the user chooses a particular option, our team will carefully review whether the
project is worth taking on. If the creation passes our examination, we will create a
Twitter account and a Discord server for that project and try to reach as many people as
possible using an extensive marketing campaign before the actual airdrop of the NFT
collection. We will then turn that work into an NFT collection and list it on an existing
NFT marketplace like OpenSea and Rarible. We will continue the digital marketing
campaign for an agreed-upon time and use successful digital marketing techniques to
increase our reach.
